# **Description:**

Blast Em To Bits - A Space Themed Open World Game By Matthew Wethington Showcasing High Performance, Immersive Destruction Physics In A Third Person Open World Shooter Game.

This Is My Semester Project For CS 6323 (Computer Animation And Gaming) For The Fall of 2020 Semester.

# **Gameplay:**

In this game, the player controls a spaceship, which is placed in orbit around an alien planet. This planet is surrounded by a ring of asteroids, which itself is populated with enemy ships. The player's goal is to destroy all the enemy ships without dying.

There is a huge emphasis on destructability as a gameplay element in this game. Asteroids can be shot to break them apart. Planned correctly, fragments from destroyed asteroids can hit enemy ships and inflict significant damage. Enemy ships themselves will break upart upon destruction. The player must be careful to not run into asteroid or enemy ship fragments, as a collision with the player's ship will damage it.
